# Malaria-project
This aims at deploying a ml model that predicts severity of malaria based on certain symptoms.

the Input pipeline is a modeule that collects the data from the server and converts it to a form the model can work with

json_read is a module that reads in the json file
model pipe is where the training and validation and testing of the model takes place
that's all i can remember really

ah yes the preprocessing module performs the data preprocessing steps: just an encodeer though
